Adding a "sample" task should be fairly straightforward, although
routing the SIGALRM signals might be nontrival (and do we really
want to implement an alarm scheduler?).  The obvious use is
accumulators that roll over often, e.g., PKG_ENERGY_STATUS.
Wouldn't mind having SAMPLE:control_cpu:sampled_cpus:msr:interval_ms
Sampling as its own task hierarchy

Put in a silly "printf the version" function and use it for both
--help and --version.

Revisit how we handle input errors (e.g., the ':' case doesn't
give a helpful message).

print_cpuset() should really be cpuset2str().

Eventually add seperate builds for release, debug,
sanitize=address and sanitize=thread

cpuset checks don't check to see if the cpu physically exists.
Parse /sys/devices/system/cpu?

Longitudinal:  CAPFREQUENCY

Make address and thread sanitizing useful.

--dry-run

clean up makefile

Really need WAIT_UNTIL:msr:relation:value:mask:seconds

Summary statistics

Add PLATFORM_ENERGY to polling

Replace asserts with intelligible error messages.

Update options dump

Need to have a "last op" marker and check for it during polling.

Unused fields get printed out.
