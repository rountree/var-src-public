Adding a "sample" task should be fairly straightforward, although
routing the SIGALRM signals might be nontrival (and do we really
want to implement an alarm scheduler?).  The obvious use is
accumulators that roll over often, e.g., PKG_ENERGY_STATUS.

Could also add a "oneoff" task for MSRs that only need to be read
once (e.g., RAPL units).

Change --seconds to --timeout that can take values with suffixes
d (day), h (hour), m (minute), or s (seconds).

Put in a silly "printf the version" function and use it for both
--help and --version.

Revisit how we handle input errors (e.g., the ':' case doesn't
give a helpful message).

print_cpuset() should really be cpuset2str().

Eventually add seperate builds for release, debug,
sanitize=address and sanitize=thread

cpuset checks don't check to see if the cpu physically exists.
Parse /sys/devices/system/cpu?

Add scrub_batch() to remove error codes (makes them reusable).

Sampling as its own task hierarchy

Longitudinal:  CAPFREQUENCY

Longitudinal:  COLDSTART

Longitudinal:  ZEROAMPERF

To move things along, a benchmark that has an execution cpu_set_t
with n eligible CPUs will cause n threads of that benchmark to be
executed, with every thread using the same shared cpu_set_t.  We'll
rely on the scheduler not to do anything stupid.  In the future,
each thread should generate its own cpu_set_t with only the eligible
cpu that it'll be using, and call sched_setaffinity() with it.

Make address and thread sanitizing useful.

Implement SLEEP and SPIN benchmarks

Add global timer (including masking thread signals).

Longitudinal:  RAPLBOUNDARY

Add a "start" as an alias for "longitudinal".

Use TSC instead of MPERF in msr-safe?

vernier input 8-byte write val

msr-safe allowlist overwrite option

Write output to separate files.

--dry-run

clean up makefile

Add option to clip TSC to 53 bits (work around R limitation).

If 0xdecafbad is in the error field, don't print the sample.
